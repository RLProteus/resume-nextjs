This is my resume built with NextJS (React) and Tailwind CSS. Resume content is written in the `resume.json` file and dynamically rendered.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can modify `app/data/resume.json` which closely (but not exactly) follows the [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) Schema. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
